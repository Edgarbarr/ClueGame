Clue - the murder mystery game
------------------------------
------------------------------

Clue is a Java terminal game based on the old school board game.
A murder has been committed in an old mansion. The murderer and 
weapon are still in the house. As you tour the house, you receive
clues that should help you solve the crime. Each room gives you
a clue to the crime - the more clues you have, the better you can
catch a murderer. You are carefully guided through the game. 
It's fun!

You will be presented with numerous choices throughout the game. 
There are 9 rooms, 10 characters and 10 weapons, so it can be 
quite challenging given the vast possibilities.

To get started, you will enter your name and begin the mystery!!
Lists of rooms, characters and weapons will be presented to you.
You will receive two clues in every room you visit. It's very 
interactive and you will have many choices and decisions to make.
The more you learn, the better your guesses will be when it is
time to reveal the culprit.

How to Play:
1.Unzip the JAR where you need it to be.
2.Load the game and prepare to play.

  clue.
5.You can also review lists of Rooms, Weapons and Characters at any
  time, to help you determine your guess.
6.Each time you guess, your solution will be compared to the actual
  solution, so you get continuous feedback throughout the game.
7.You can select "0" at any time to quit the game. Once you quit, the
  the unsolved mystery will be revealed.
